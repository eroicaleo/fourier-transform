Fourier Series 1.1 Choices: Welcome Aboard The question of convergence of Fourier series, believe it or not, led G. Cantor near the turn of the 20th century to investigate and invent the theory of infinite sets and to distinguish di\ufb00erent cardinalities of infinite sets. 1.2 1.2.1. Time and space. The frequency and wavelength are related through the equation v = \u03bb\u03bd , which is the same as speed = distance/time. More on spatial periodicity. a crystal has a regular, repeating pattern of atoms in space; the arrangement of atoms is called a lattice. The function that describes the electron density distribution of the crystal is then a periodic function of the spatial variables, in three dimensions, that describes the crystal. 1.2.2. Definitions, examples, and things to come. f(t) is defined on \\mathbb{R} . The smallest T such that f(t+T) = f(t) is called the fundamental period of the function. Is the sum of two periodic functions periodic? No, consider \\cos t and \\cos \\sqrt[]{2}t . 1.2.3. The building blocks: A few more examples. The state of the harmonic oscillator system is described by a single sinusoid, say of the form A \\sin (2 \\pi \\nu t + \\phi ) The period is \\nu .
